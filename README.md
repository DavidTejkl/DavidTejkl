- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @DavidTejkl
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in frontend developing and everything about AI and AI/machine learning.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about focus on building applications with large language models (LLMs) and taking them into production. I work with modern models (GPT, Claude, and openâ€‘source), use RAG to connect AI with company knowledge, experiment with QLoRA fineâ€‘tuning, and build multimodal solutions across text, audio, and images. Iâ€™m passionate about autonomous AI agents. I design and build them with frameworks like OpenAI Agents SDK, CrewAI, LangGraph, and AutoGen, gaining handsâ€‘on experience with multiâ€‘agent orchestration, the Model Context Protocol (MCP), and production deployments.
